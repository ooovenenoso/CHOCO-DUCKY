# Ducky Scripts for Software Installation with Chocolatey

![](https://github.com/ooovenenoso/GOODUSB/blob/main/Cyber%20Ducky.png?raw=true)

## Description:
These scripts are designed to automate the installation process for various programs using the Chocolatey package manager on Windows computers. The scripts utilize Ducky Script language and are intended for use with USB Rubber Ducky devices or other Ducky Script compatible devices.

## How it Works:
1. The script begins by setting the execution policy to bypass system restrictions.
2. It downloads the Chocolatey installation script from its official website.
3. Once Chocolatey is installed and set up, the script proceeds to install the specific program using the `choco install [program-name]` command.
4. Finally, the script sends the "A" key followed by the "Enter" key to accept any pop-up messages and complete the installation.

## Note:
Before running any script on a system, ensure you fully understand its operation. Keep in mind that changing the execution policy and downloading and installing software can have security implications. It's always recommended to test in a controlled environment before using the scripts on a production system.
